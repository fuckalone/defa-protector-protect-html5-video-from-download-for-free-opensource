What do these software doing?

It protect your html5 video from download but doesn't protect from screen recording

I see a media fallback link ( unprotect video link ) in video. How should I fix?

These are usually comes with Wordpress Built in Video Player. Change it to Secure HTML5 Video Player instead. The problems gone and video load a lot faster

Why some browser cannot play the video?

Because Defa Protector doesn't send you  a real video files making some browser video player cannot play

What is nojavascript.php and spoof.php on juthawong.com does?

nojavascript.php and spoof.php is just a file redirect to stop hackers from spoofing useragent and hacking the video for download. You can remove it as you want but it will lessen your video security.
